# Phase 1 Journal — Pulse

## Step 0: Prep

- Repository created: 07-11-2025
- Folder structure initialized
- Connected to GitHub
- `README.md` file created

## Step 1: Mapping (07 Nov 2025)

- Revisited _Crafting Interpreters_ chapters.
- Created `docs/mapping.md` linking each chapter to corresponding Pulse implementation components.
- Defined which features from Lox will be reused or extended (Lexer, Parser, AST, Interpreter).
- Decided Pulse will start as a tree-walk interpreter with tensor support added later.

## Step 2: Problem Statement & Scope (28 Nov 2025)

- Wrote the formal problem statement explaining why Pulse is needed and who benefits.
- Defined project scope for v1: Lexer, Parser, AST, Interpreter, REPL, and NumPy-backed tensor operations.
- Listed out-of-scope features for v1: JIT, GPU execution, advanced type system, full OOP, modules.
- Created `docs/problem-and-scope.md` as the official deliverable.
